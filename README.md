# purescript-trivial-unfold
A simple library providing existential wrappers around transparently represented `unfoldr` and `unfoldr1` calls. Intended as an adapter from functions in other libraries with polymorphic `Unfoldable a` or `Unfoldable1 a` result types, but also provides miscellaneous related utility functions.
